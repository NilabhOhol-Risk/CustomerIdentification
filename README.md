# CustomerIdentification
This project identifies potential customers for a non-profit organization. 
Problem Description:
You are working for a non-profit as a Data Scientist and has volunteered to assist a charity to develop a tool to optimize their outreach efforts. Objective is to determine which set of potential donors the charity should contact to maximize the profitability of a marketing campaign to solicit donations for the charity.

1.	The cost of marketing to a particular potential donor varies per zip code. This cost is paid regardless of whether the potential donor responds to our marketing or not. This cost is specified in the file zipCodeMarketingCosts.csv.
2.	Only if a customer responds to our request, do we receive the donation amount. 
3.	The “amount” variable does not include the marketing cost.  
4.	Profitability of campaign = sum of all amounts received – sum of all marketing costs for customers to whom you marketed.
